**Useroutr**

**Product Documentation**

*Pay anything. Settle everywhere.*

Version 1.0  ·  February 2026

# **1\. Introduction**

Useroutr is a full-stack payment infrastructure platform for businesses and developers. It unifies traditional fiat payment rails with crypto-native infrastructure enabling anyone to accept or send money across blockchain networks and currencies through a single SDK, API, or no-code dashboard.

Useroutr is built on the Stellar blockchain, leveraging Stellar's native path payments, Soroban smart contracts, and its global anchor network to deliver near-instant, low-cost settlement in any currency. The platform bridges the gap that currently exists between fiat-native processors (like Stripe or Flutterwave) and crypto-native payment solutions giving businesses one place to handle everything.

## **1.1 Who is Useroutr for?**

Useroutr serves two primary audiences:

* Developers & Businesses (B2B) teams building fintech products, marketplaces, e-commerce platforms, or any application that needs to accept or disburse payments across currencies and chains.

* End Consumers (B2C) individuals paying for goods or services through a Useroutr-powered checkout, payment link, or invoice, using fiat or crypto from any supported wallet or bank.

## **1.2 The Problem Useroutr Solves**

Today's payment landscape is fragmented in two directions:

* Fiat-side: Accepting payments globally means integrating multiple processors, managing currency conversion, dealing with high fees, and navigating complex compliance requirements per region.

* Crypto-side: Every blockchain has its own tokens, wallets, liquidity silos, and developer tooling. A USDC on Ethereum is not the same as USDC on Solana forcing developers to build and maintain multi-chain infrastructure that most apps simply don't need.

Useroutr removes both layers of friction. Merchants choose where they want to settle fiat accounts, crypto wallet, or Stellar assets and Useroutr handles everything in between.

# **2\. Platform Architecture**

Useroutr is composed of four core layers that work together to route, convert, and settle payments.

## **2.1 Inbound Layer**

The inbound layer is responsible for receiving payments from any source a customer's credit card, bank transfer, or crypto wallet on any supported chain.

* Fiat inbound: Card payments (Visa/Mastercard) and bank transfers (ACH, SEPA, local rails) are processed via licensed payment partners and converted to stablecoins on Stellar.

* Crypto inbound (same-chain): Direct deposits of Stellar-native assets (XLM, USDC on Stellar, any SEP-asset) are received natively.

* Crypto inbound (cross-chain): Assets from EVM chains (Ethereum, Base, Avalanche, etc.) are bridged using Circle CCTP for USDC and Wormhole for broader asset support. Assets from Solana are bridged similarly via Wormhole.

## **2.2 Routing & Conversion Layer**

Once funds arrive on Stellar, the routing engine determines the optimal conversion path to the merchant's preferred settlement asset.

* Stellar Path Payments: Useroutr uses Stellar's native path payment mechanism (findStrictSendPaths / findStrictReceivePaths) to find the best multi-hop route across the Stellar DEX and AMM liquidity pools.

* Soroban Smart Contracts: Custom settlement logic, fee deduction, refund rules, and multi-tenant disbursement are handled by Soroban contracts deployed on Stellar Mainnet.

* Slippage protection and quote locking: Useroutr locks quotes for 30 seconds, ensuring the merchant receives exactly the quoted amount.

## **2.3 Settlement Layer**

Settlement is the final delivery of funds to the merchant or recipient. Useroutr supports three settlement modes:

* Crypto Settlement: Funds land in a Stellar wallet as any Stellar-native asset (USDC, XLM, or any anchored asset).

* Fiat Off-Ramp: Stellar anchors (regulated on/off ramp operators using SEP-6/SEP-24 standards) convert on-chain funds to fiat and deliver to a bank account or mobile money wallet.

* Cross-Border Fiat: Useroutr supports Fiat → Stellar → Fiat flows for cross-border payments, enabling businesses to send money internationally at Stellar's near-zero transaction cost.

## **2.4 Developer & Merchant Layer**

The top layer is what developers and merchants interact with directly:

* Useroutr SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go) \- embed payment flows directly into applications.

* Useroutr REST API \- full programmatic control over payments, quotes, webhooks, and account management.

* Useroutr Dashboard \- no-code tools for creating payment links, invoices, viewing transactions, and managing settings.

# **3\. Products**

Useroutr offers five core product modules. Each can be used independently or together as a unified payment stack.

## **3.1 Useroutr Gateway**

Useroutr Gateway is a hosted checkout experience that accepts fiat and crypto payments in a single, embeddable flow. Merchants integrate it with a script tag or SDK call and immediately gain access to every payment method Useroutr supports.

### **Key Features**

* Accepts credit/debit cards, bank transfers (ACH/SEPA/local rails), and crypto from 10+ chains in one checkout session.

* Hosted by Useroutr, PCI-DSS scope is handled entirely on Useroutr's infrastructure.

* Customizable branding: logo, colors, and domain via CNAME.

* Real-time conversion quotes shown to the payer before confirmation.

* Webhook notifications on payment status changes (pending, completed, failed, refunded).

### **Integration**

import { UseroutrCheckout } from "@useroutr/sdk";

const checkout \= new UseroutrCheckout({

  apiKey: "tv\_live\_xxxxxxxxxxxx",

  amount: 5000,      // in cents

  currency: "USD",

  settlementAsset: "USDC",

  orderId: "order\_123",

  onSuccess: (payment) \=\> console.log(payment),

});

checkout.open();

## **3.2 Useroutr Links**

Useroutr Links lets merchants generate shareable payment URLs in seconds with no code required. Links can be shared via WhatsApp, email, SMS, or embedded in any digital surface.

### **Key Features**

* Create a link from the dashboard in under 30 seconds.

* Set a fixed amount or allow the payer to choose the amount.

* Supports expiry dates, single-use or multi-use links.

* Accepts any Useroutr-supported payment method.

* Real-time dashboard notifications and webhook events.

* Shareable via QR code (auto-generated for every link).

### **API Creation**

{

  "amount": 2500,

  "currency": "USD",

  "description": "Design consultation \- 1 hour",

  "expires\_at": "2026-03-01T00:00:00Z",

  "single\_use": false

}

## **3.3 Useroutr Invoicing**

Useroutr Invoicing provides a professional invoicing tool that lets businesses create, send, and track invoices with customers able to pay in fiat or crypto. Merchants always settle in their preferred currency.

### **Key Features**

* Create itemized invoices with line items, taxes, and discounts.

* Supports partial payments and installment schedules.

## **3.4 Useroutr Payouts**

Useroutr Payouts is a global disbursement engine. Businesses can send bulk payments to individuals or other businesses worldwide to bank accounts, mobile money wallets, or crypto wallets in a single API call.

### **Key Features**

* Bulk payout API: send to 1 or 10,000 recipients in one request.

* Supported destination types: bank account (local and SWIFT), mobile money (M-Pesa, MTN, Airtel), and crypto wallets on any supported chain.

* Automatic FX conversion at the time of disbursement.

* Payout scheduling: immediate, scheduled, or recurring.

* Per-payout status tracking with webhook events.

### **API Example**

POST /v1/payouts/bulk

{

  "payouts": \[

    {

      "recipient\_id": "rec\_abc123",

      "amount": 10000,

      "currency": "NGN",

      "destination": { "type": "mobile\_money", "provider": "mtn", "number": "+2348012345678" }

      "destination": { "type": "bank\_account", "routing": "021000021", "account": "1234567890" }

    }

  \]

}

## **3.5 Useroutr On/Off Ramp**

Useroutr's on/off ramp module enables direct fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversion for end users or as a white-label service for platforms building their own ramp experience.

### **On-Ramp (Fiat → Crypto)**

* The user initiates a deposit in fiat (bank transfer, card, mobile money).

* Useroutr converts to the target crypto asset via Stellar anchors and path payments.

* Crypto lands in the user's specified wallet within seconds of fiat confirmation.

### **Off-Ramp (Crypto → Fiat)**

* Users send crypto to their Useroutr off-ramp address (any supported chain).

* Useroutr bridges and converts to stablecoin on Stellar, then uses anchor network to deliver fiat.

* Funds arrive in the user's bank account or mobile money wallet.

### **White-Label**

Platforms can embed Useroutr's ramp directly into their product via the SDK or iframe embed, with full custom branding and their own KYC flow via Useroutr's compliance API.

const crypto \= require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {

  const expected \= crypto

    .createHmac('sha256', secret)

    .update(payload)

    .digest('hex');

  return \`sha256=${expected}\` \=== signature;

}

# **8\. Refunds**
